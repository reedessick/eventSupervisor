**eventSupervisor** provides several standard functions which are used throughout the package.
Similarly, it declares a few classes as extensions to **lvalertMP**'s *QueueItem* and *Task* classes, which in turn are extendend for each actual monitor.

For more information about how these are used, see :doc:`architecture`
