Monitors
==================================================

**WRITE ME** 
- briefly describe the structure of the monitors

    - separate *QueueItem* for each "follow-up activity"
    - separate *Task* for each specific bit of information that should be present.

- describe how monitors are stored in the source code in different modules, but they're all treated equally.

    - source code structure is really just book-keeping.
